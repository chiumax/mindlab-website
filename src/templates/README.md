# Templates

The `index.js` file in this folder describes the structure of a generic Project page. This means that any change here will be reflected on all of the Project "deep dive" pages.

Using `.createPages` in `gatsby-node.js`, markdown files can be "injected" into this template file to seed the file with project-specific data
